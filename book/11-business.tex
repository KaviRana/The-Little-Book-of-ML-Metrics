\subsection{Conversion Rate}
In machine learning, Conversion Rate is the percentage of users who complete a desired action after being targeted by a model's recommendations or predictions.
For instance, in e-commerce conversion rate measures the percentage of users who purchase after receiving product recommendations from a machine learning model.
