# The Little Book of ML Metrics

Welcome to the open source repo of [The Little Book of ML Metrics](https://www.nannyml.com/metrics). The idea of the book is to be this little handbook that sits on every data scientist's desk for quick reference, from the most well-known metric, ahem, accuracy, to the most obscure ones (looking at you, P4 metric).
